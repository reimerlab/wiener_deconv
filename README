Wiener deconvolution methods for recovering estimated concentration dynamics from fluorescence traces

Noncausal Wiener deconvolution (deconv.py)
These are functions . Here, concentrations are estimated using a time-domain representation of the
(assumed single-exponential) impulse response for the fluorophore (see text in Neyhart, et al). The noise spectrum is assumed to be flat.

This code also includes a method for estimating the parameter W based on empirical considerations. 

Causal Wiener deconvolution (causal_deconv.py)
This code was not used in Neyhart, et al but is included here for research purposes. This
