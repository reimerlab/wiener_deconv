Wiener deconvolution methods for recovering estimated concentration dynamics from fluorescence traces

Noncausal Wiener deconvolution (deconv.py)
These are functions for computing Wiener deconvolution and denoised reconstruction of a 1D (e.g. fluorescence) time-series. Here, concentrations are estimated using a time-domain representation of the
impulse response for the fluorophore (see text in 1). The noise spectrum is assumed to be flat.

This code also includes a method for estimating the regularization parameter W based on desired absolute error. 

Causal Wiener deconvolution (causal_deconv.py)
This code was not used in (1) but is included here for research purposes. Causal Wiener deconvolution was implemented following the derivation in (2):
